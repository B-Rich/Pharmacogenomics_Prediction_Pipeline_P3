# Each set of features:
#   - has a unique name that can be used in the "features_to_use" list
#
#   - has one or more output files, which must be of the general format:
#       - rows = features
#       - columns = samples
# 
#   - has a snakefile responsible for creating the output file.
#       - paths in these snakefiles should be relative to the runall.snakefile
#         since they are included verbatim.
#       - interdependencies between feature snakefiles can be handled by using
#         the snakemake directive "include:"
